Analysing-Employee-Performance-for-Hr-Analytics
In this project I use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.
This project Has to modules.
Module 1 : here I have transformed the data using Python and exported the CSV to work further in SQL, in transforming the by hendeling null values removing                  irrelevant data etc.
Modeule 2 : here I have worked on some insight questions. the function which i have used here is mostly basics, AVG, MAX, SUM with some intermediate function like             Case expression.
